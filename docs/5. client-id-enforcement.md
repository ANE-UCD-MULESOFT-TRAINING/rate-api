        - In order for API to autodiscover, we need to include our anypoint platform client ID and secret under Properties upon deployment. See the screenshot below.

        - Note : To find your client id and secret, go to Anypoint Platform, navigate to Access Management, Environments, and click on whatever environment you are deploying on (whether that is Sandbox, Production etc), and copy and paste your client id and secret into the corresponding fields on the deployment screen.
